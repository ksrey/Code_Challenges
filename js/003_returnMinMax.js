//Your task is to make two functions (max and min, or maxiumum and minimum, depending on the language) that receive a list of integers as input and return, respectively, the largest and lowest numbers in that list.

//Parameters: will the list be blank?
//Return: the largest and lowest numbers
//Example: min [1,2,3,4] returns [1] max returns [4]
//Psuedo code: create two functions using min and max with list of integers


const min = (list) => Math.min(...list);
const max = (list) => Math.max(...list);
